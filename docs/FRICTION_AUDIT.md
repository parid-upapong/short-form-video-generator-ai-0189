# Friction Audit & UX Solutions

| Potential Friction Point | AI-Driven Solution | UX Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Choice Paralysis**: Too many segments found. | **Ranking System**: AI assigns a "Viral Score" to every segment. | Only show the Top 3 segments by default; hide others under "More Clips." |
| **Editing Complexity**: 9:16 cropping is tedious. | **Auto-Face Tracking**: AI identifies the speaker and centers them automatically. | A simple toggle: [x] Follow Speaker. No manual keyframing needed. |
| **Caption Fatigue**: Typing out subtitles. | **Whisper-Large Integration**: 99% accurate auto-captions. | User chooses a "Visual Style" instead of editing individual words. |
| **Wait Times**: Large files take time to analyze. | **Asynchronous Processing**: Notify via email/push when "Clips are Ready." | Users can start another project or leave the tab while AI works. |
| **Onboarding**: "How do I start?" | **Template First**: Offer "Popular Creator" presets immediately. | "Click here to make a clip like [Popular Creator]." |

## Success Metrics (KPIs)
1. **Time to First Clip (TTFC)**: Target < 2 minutes from upload to preview.
2. **Export Ratio**: % of uploaded videos that result in at least one export.
3. **Edit-to-Export Ratio**: Measure how many manual changes users make (Lower is better, meaning AI got it right).

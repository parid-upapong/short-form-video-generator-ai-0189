# UX Flow: From Long-form to Viral Short

## Step 1: Input & Analyze
1. User drops a YouTube link.
2. The system starts **Asynchronous Processing**:
    - Task A: Audio Extraction & Transcription.
    - Task B: Scene Change Detection.

3. *Status UI:* "AI is watching your video... identifying viral moments."

## Step 2: The Selection Grid
1. User is presented with 5-10 "Viral Candidates."
2. Each candidate shows:
    - **Viral Score**: (e.g., 92% - High Hook Potential).
    - **Transcript Snippet**: The first 2 sentences.
    - **Auto-Title**: (e.g., "The Secret to $10k/month").
3. User clicks "Open in Studio" on the best candidate.

## Step 3: The Studio (The "One-Click" Polish)

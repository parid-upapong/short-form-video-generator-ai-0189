# Core User Flow: The "Long-to-Short" Viral Pipeline

This document defines the frictionless path from a raw long-form video to a high-engagement short-form clip.

## Phase 1: Ingestion (The "Input" Stage)
1. **Entry Point**: User lands on Dashboard and clicks `+ New Viral Project`.
2. **Import Options**: 
    - Paste URL (YouTube/Twitch/Drive).
    - Local File Upload (Drag & Drop).
3. **Preference Setting (Optional/Fast)**: 
    - AI asks: "What's the goal?" (Funny, Educational, High-Energy).
    - AI asks: "Primary Platform?" (TikTok, Reels, Shorts).
4. **The "Magic" Trigger**: User clicks `Viralize Now`.

## Phase 2: AI Synthesis (The "Waiting" Stage)
*Goal: Minimize perceived wait time.*
1. **Processing Screen**: A dynamic progress bar showing sub-tasks:
    - *Transcribing audio...*
    - *Identifying facial expressions...*
    - *Analyzing hook potential...*
2. **Contextual Tips**: Display viral trends/tips while the AI works.

## Phase 3: Curation & Review (The "Selection" Stage)
1. **Highlight Grid**: User is presented with 3-5 AI-selected "Viral Candidates."
2. **Quick-View Metadata**: Each candidate displays:
    - **Viral Score**: (e.g., 92/100) based on hook strength.
    - **AI Justification**: "This segment has a strong emotional peak at 0:45."
    - **Transcribed Hook**: The first 3 seconds of text.
3. **Primary Action**: User selects the best candidate to enter the "Refine Studio."

## Phase 4: Refine & Polish (The "Refining" Stage)
*Constraint: No complex timelines. Everything is template-driven.*
1. **Auto-Framing**: AI detects the speaker and centers them for 9:16 aspect ratio.
2. **Dynamic Captions**: 
    - User selects a "Caption Style" (e.g., "Alex Hormozi style," "Minimalist," "Neon").
    - AI auto-syncs text with speech.
3. **Instant Preview**: Real-time playback of the final result.

## Phase 5: Export & Distribution (The "Output" Stage)
1. **Export Options**:
    - Download 1080p MP4.
    - Post directly to TikTok/Reels (via API).
2. **Feedback Loop**: "Is this clip fire?" (Thumb up/down to train the AI on user preference).

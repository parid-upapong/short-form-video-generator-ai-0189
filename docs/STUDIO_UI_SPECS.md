# UI Specifications: The Refine Studio

To maintain "frictionless" flow, the Studio must avoid the "Premiere Pro look."

## 1. Top Bar (Status)
- Project Name (Editable)
- Progress: [Draft -> Edited -> Ready]
- Export Button (Primary CTA - Distinct Color)

## 2. Left Panel (Styling)
- **Caption Presets**: Grid of thumbnails showing different font styles/animations.
- **B-Roll Toggle**: Switch to turn on/off AI-generated B-roll overlays.
- **Audio**: Background music recommendations based on clip mood.

## 3. Center (The Stage)
- **9:16 Video Player**: Always shows the vertical crop.
- **Visual Handles**: If the user wants to adjust the crop, they drag the video directly, not a slider.

## 4. Bottom (The Strip)
- **Word-Level Timeline**: Instead of a timeline of frames, show a timeline of *words*. 
- **Action**: Clicking a word allows for "Split Clip" or "Correction."

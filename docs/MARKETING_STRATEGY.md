# Growth Marketing Strategy: Project VIRAL-FLOW

## 1. The Viral Loop (Product-Led Growth)
To scale exponentially, the product must market itself.

- **Referral Credits:** Users earn "AI Minutes" for every successful referral who signs up and processes their first video.
- **Social Sharing Integration:** One-click publish to TikTok/Reels with auto-generated captions including a branded hashtag #ViralFlowAI.

## 2. Programmatic SEO (P-SEO) Strategy
Target "Long-tail" creator intent by generating landing pages for every niche:
- "How to turn [Podcast Name] into TikToks"
- "Best AI editor for [Game Title] streamers"
- "Repurpose [YouTube Channel Category] for Reels"

## 3. The "Creator-First" Distribution
- **Affiliate Program:** 30% recurring commission for influencers who review the tool.
- **Niche Communities:** Active presence in r/NewTubers, r/Twitch, and Discord servers for creators, offering free "Viral Audits" of their long-form content.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
